# Persistent Systems Interview Experience: A Journey to Success
Greetings Readers,

I am thrilled to share my enriching experience of securing a SDE Internship position at Persistent Systems Pune, an opportunity that I pursued through my college campus in the academic year 2023-24.

**ROUND 1: Aptitude Test**
The journey commenced with an aptitude test, comprising multifaceted sections including logical reasoning, verbal aptitude, technical acumen, and coding prowess. The technical segment delved into crucial domains such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS), Database Management Systems (DBMS), Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Computer Networks (CN), with a predominant focus on Operating Systems (OS). Additionally, two coding challenges, ranging from easy to medium to hard levels, tested our problem-solving abilities under a stringent time limit of 45 minutes. Post coding, a quantitative aptitude section added a final layer of assessment.

After a brief wait, on 3rd January 2024, I received an email intimating about the interview scheduled at the Persistent office in Pune on 5th January 2024.

**Interview Round 1: Technical Profundity**
The technical interview commenced with a comprehensive discussion on my projects, providing a platform to showcase my practical knowledge and expertise. Delving deeper into my core programming language, Java, the interviewer navigated through a series of medium-level inquiries encompassing Java memory management including Heap and Stack memory, Java Singleton pattern, Garbage Collection (GC) mechanism, distinctions between 'throw' and 'throws', nuances of 'final', 'finally', and 'finalize' keywords, and the essence of static entities like classes, variables, and methods.

In addition to Java, the interview encompassed probing questions spanning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Database Management Systems (DBMS), Computer Networks (CN), and Operating Systems (OS). Furthermore, a program debugging task and predicting the output of a given program added a practical dimension to the evaluation, culminating in a fruitful interaction lasting approximately an hour.

**Interview Round 2: A Second Iteration**
Following the initial technical scrutiny, only seven candidates proceeded to the subsequent round, which relatively eased in comparison to the former. This round primarily focused on fundamental concepts of Java, DBMS, OS, CN, and DSA. Questions ranged from elucidating application layer protocols, understanding SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), discerning distinctions between HTTP and HTTPS, to expounding upon TCP/IP architecture and the boot sequence of a computer system.

**HR Round: A Personal Touch**
In the concluding HR round, I engaged in a candid discussion regarding my personal introduction, strengths, and areas of improvement. Remarkably, during the interview, the HR graciously extended the offer of selection, fostering an atmosphere of warmth and encouragement. The brief yet insightful conversation lasted for about 5-10 minutes, encapsulating the essence of professionalism and congeniality.

In retrospect, my journey through the Persistent Systems interview process was not only intellectually stimulating but also profoundly gratifying, marking a pivotal milestone in my professional trajectory.
